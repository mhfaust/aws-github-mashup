## aws-github-mashup
This is the dashboard for understanding what version of running services are deployed to any of a set of VPCs.

## Instructions for Running
You'll need AWS creds installed on the machine running this, and a GitHub Token in its environment with the name GIT_TOKEN. 

If you have not previously built this, you can just run ```npm start```.  If you have previously built the version you have, just use ```npm run serve```.
